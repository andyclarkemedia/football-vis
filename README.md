This repository contains all of the project files for the data visualisation series - "Playmakers of the 2018 World Cup"

Created as part of the data visualisation module in the MSc Computational & Data Journalism programme at Cardiff University

This project explores the best playmakers in the 2018 World Cup according to football events data provided by WyScout. Using d3, I produced three interactive visualisations to enable users to compare playmakers, investigate player combinations and discover the individual plays that contribute to a playerâ€™s playmaking rank.
